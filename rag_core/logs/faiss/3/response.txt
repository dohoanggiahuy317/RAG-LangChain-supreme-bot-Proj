We continue to track and report our progress and strengthen our goals as needed to drive improved performance.

We work to address many interconnected climate challenges, including ingredient and raw material scarcity, more frequent and severe natural disasters, water stress, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy management and packaging.

For example, climate resilience is a key aspect of our water strategy; our.

sustainable agriculture.

practices include a focus on lower carbon emissions; and our.

World Without Waste.

initiative contributes significantly to our GHG reduction goals.

We also recognize that the impacts of climate change are not equally felt across geographies and populations, which can exacerbate inequality and social unrest, and in turn, can also affect our business.

To ensure we address these risks — and understand impact and opportunity — we have increased the ambition and reach of our climate goals across the Coca‑Cola system.

To ensure we address these risks — and understand impact and opportunity — we have increased the ambition and reach of our climate goals across the Coca‑Cola system.

Our “drink in your hand” goal was set in 2013 to take a step toward reducing GHG emissions.

We met our goal to cut our carbon footprint across our full value chain by 25% by the end of 2020, against a 2010 baseline.

As of 2022, we reduced our emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 7%, making progress toward our science-based reduction target of 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline.

Our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

In 2022, our Scope 1 emissions were 4.

4 million metric tons, Scope 2 emissions were 3.

5 million metric tons and Scope 3 emissions were 57.

0 million metric tons.

Achieving these reductions will require us to continue the progress we have made over the last few years.

The work we are doing through sustainable agriculture and product reformulations will help us achieve the target.
